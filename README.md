# NIH-chestxray-dataset-sample

Kaggle created [this dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/sample/data) of 5606 images, representing a randomly selected 5% of the [full NIH](https://www.kaggle.com/nih-chest-xrays/data) dataset, to use in machine learning.

I am not inclined to upload the full dataset of 112,120 images unless someone needs it. If you want this, file an issue or open a PR and we'll make it happen.
